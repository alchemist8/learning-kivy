to build exe

1. first generate the spec file
-python -m PyInstaller --noconsole --name CBMS Src/main.py
a spec file will be generated

2. add this line to the spec file
-from kivy_deps import sdl2, glew

3. Then, find COLLECT() and add the data
-Tree('Src\\'),
add this after the exe this should contain all the source code tree with one entry point main file
-*[Tree(p) for p in (sdl2.dep_bins + glew.dep_bins)],
add this after the a.datas,

4. Now build the spec file which will contain the exec file in dist folder with the app name (CBMS), which can be zipped and shared
-python -m PyInstaller --noconsole CBMS.spec
